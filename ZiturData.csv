1 to 2 well
now I need my calculator here's my graph
of 1 over X and I want to find the area
so I can do number seven here under 2nd
calc and I'm going to do it from one to
two and there's my point 6 930 we've
seen that before and then we can go on
and calculates more from elbow from 1230
we've seen that one too okay then the
other one well if I do one to e so
second calc from one number 7 from 1 to
e oh that's going to be one I hope you
see in what's happening here this
integral is actually where the natural
logarithm came from and so if i put
these values in from one to two of this
one is going to be 0 point 693 from one
to three is going to be 1.0 98 and then
de it's just going to be 1 and then 27 I
bet it's going to be 1 point 9 45 so if
I needed to define this thing I'm think
that we could call this the natural log
of x okay so that's the integral from 1
to X of that thing also e is the limit
as X goes to infinity you should have
poured that in precalculus but we have
this limit 1 plus 1 over x rays the
X as X goes to infinity is where e comes
from tribe investigating that a little
bit more if you're confused on that we
have some other things that we need we
have the change of base formula so if I
have a base that I don't like for
instance here a I can change it over to
base B by going across log of x divided
by log of a which is the base put it
there also some other properties we have
the log of a product is equal to some of
the logs and then we can do that with
the ln2 log of a quotient is equal to
the difference of the logs and then we
have the power property which I call the
plug rule so if I have the log of some
power here I can take that exponent and
bring it out in front plog okay or
pollen you don't forget that one ok so
those are rules that you should know and
then ln x and e to the X are inverses of
each other so if you take the
composition of the inverses you should
end up with X so here is and this isn't
this is just a regular log with base a
but if these bases are the same a to
what power gives you a to the you it's
got to be you this is the same exact
thing except for the base is e so I get
that this was a little bit tricky for
people because this one just says a to
what power gives you you well I'm taking
a to that power so I better get you and
then this one if you have me in
precalculus I say well for this one here
I say if it spells line you can draw a
line through it this one I made make fun
it's not true but I say what's the
Chinese word for line well it's Elm
because in Chinese they have the
different tones so this is the second
tone rising Elm you can cross it off and
you're just left with the you all right
why don't you go ahead and graph these
you can graph these and play around with
some of the domain and range and I'll
come back to you here in a minute so
pause this and do that okay so if you
sketch graphs of these I didn't do a
very accurate job but these will look
pretty similar because II is 2.72 and
then this base over here is 3 and when
we look at those things then
me pause here so if I look here at the y
equals e to the X this is y equals e to
the X that's an exponential goes through
the point zero one all Exponential's
that don't have a leading coefficient
will go through 01 so since these two
functions are inverses of each other
then the logarithmic function will go
through 10 this one's strictly in Crete
Oh both of them are strictly increase
you know that's right if I have inverse
functions and one is strictly increasing
the other one will be strictly
increasing and so with this one domain
would be all reals for the EDX and then
the range is y greater than 0 because I
just show up above the x-axis here then
we just switch x and y to find the
inverse so I got to just switch this
domain and this range over and then very
similar fashion 3 the X is going to give
you the same domain and range notice to
this point is 0-1 this point is 10 so
this is y equal to the log of X base 3
okay now moving on using some of these
operations that we had earlier if I go
on the split screen here what we want to
do is we want to use some of these
properties to split this up so if you
see this one this is log of a product
and so I can take this log of a product
and I can split it up this base will
stay the same it's all come and
logarithm so its base 10 so it would be
log of 6 plus log of X plus log of Y
squared now with this these are pretty
much simplified as much as they can this
one however is as a squared here so we
can go ahead and use the plug rule so
this would be equal to log of 6 plus log
of X plus I can take this to put it on
in front so it be to log of Y that would
be expanding and we need this technique
in order to do some of our derivatives
now with this one this one's a little
bit more involved I have this X Y so i
can do ln x plus ln
I'm sorry that's a Z plus ln z now in
this denominator since i'm dividing i
got to use this rule so i'm going to
subtract out Ln of square root of Y
squared plus 1 now instead of square
root what I maybe should do is take that
out and make an exponent of one half
then i can plug that so then this is
going to be equal to ln x plus ln z
minus one-half ln y squared plus 1 then
we want to split this up oh wait a
second can we does this fit any of our
rules do I have a log of a sum no I
don't so this is finished this is all I
can do log of a sum cannot be simplified
it's the log of a product turns into a
sum of logs alright so that's all you
can do there if we want to work in
reverse order if we want to condense
these I now I can go unplug this one so
i can use this rule so this would be log
of x to the one-half and then plus undo
this one put this one up as well so this
would be log of X plus 1 raised to the
fourth and then I have log some of logs
so i can take this one and work in
reverse here so this would be log of x
to the one-half x plus 1 raised to the
fourth so then it be the log of the
product of those two if we do this next
one i can distribute this one third on
all of these or i can condense these
first and then apply the one third one i
do if they condensing inside first so
this is a sum so with a sum oh i got to
put this one up so i'm going to need to
put the two up above this one so I I
take the sum and i'm going to multiply
so it'd be X plus 5 quantity squared
this is a difference so then I need to
so divide this one and it inside the
logarithmic function I need Z cubed so
that's what I'm going to have now what
did I lose but I lost by one third I
still need that so now I'm going to take
that one and put that up so overall this
becomes ln x x plus 5 quantity squared
all over Z cubed to the one third okay
that will help us greatly for our rules
coming up now finally to the calculus
since at the beginning we had we kind of
found this out this isn't exactly true
I'll show you exactly what it is later
but we have the integral of 1 over T
from 1 to X equal to Ln X so in other
words if i take the derivative of this
thing then I should get 1 over X so in
other words the derivative of ln x is 1
over X and that's what we have right
here and if we have it in terms of
something different than just plain X Ln
you we would have to chain off by that
you so now we're just going to use this
rule to find some derivatives y prime is
equal to take one over the object here
and then chain off well the derivative
of x is just x so I just get that that's
our rule this one I'll use dy/dx is time
for notation 1 over 3x write down as it
is and don't forget to chain so the
chain of the 3x is the three now you
notice the threes cancel here and so I'm
left what how did that happen so what
happens with this is that I can take
this and use our logarithmic rules and
split this up this would be Ln 3 plus ln
x well if i do y prime of this what's
the drivel and three well this is just a
constant what's the derivative constant
zero and so i just am left with 1 over X
so there's two ways to do it both turns
out to be the same this next one number
3 y prime is equal to take one over the
object of the logarithm it logarithm 1
over the cosine
and then chain it off derivative cosine
is going to be negative sign so this
turns out to be negative tangent of X
hmm interesting oh I guess then if we
take the integral of tangent we'll get
something like this well we'll figure
that out later now if I look at
something like this let's see some weird
stuff happening with this one 1 over x
squared times the chain would be x 2x
one of those is going to cancel so this
is equal to one of the x's cancel i'm
left with 2 over x oh how did that
happen well let's figure this one out if
i rewrite this to ln x then y prime is
just going to be to the constant we go
along for the ride and then x 1 over x
which is the derivative a land x 0 2
over X doesn't matter which way you do
it all this stuff falls into place
wonderful now with this one you have a
composition of three functions I don't
know if there's logarithmic rules that
you can use to split this up or not but
I'm just going to go ahead with brute
strength and awkwardness and crank this
out so I'm going to take the derivative
ln so it's 1 over the object of the
logarithm which is this then I have to
chain well the derivative of ln x cubed
is going to be 1 over X cubed and I need
to chain again since its composition of
three functions I need two chains so
this derivative would be 3x squared so
this is chain number one and this is
chain number two alright so there's some
basic derivatives that we can look at
now we can get into some stuff that's a
little bit more tricky what we maybe
want to do is use some of our rules of
logarithms to split some of this up and
that might make it a little bit easier
for us so when finding F prime here
I want to rewrite this logarithm by
splitting it up well this is a quotient
so I'm going to take log of x over log
of a quotient difference of the logs
this is going to be Ln of the square
root of x squared plus 2 well x squared
plus 2 as an exponent one-half so I'm
going to put the one-half out in front
and plug that so now if I do F prime
this is 1 over x and then minus the one
half goes along for the ride I'm going
to do one over x squared plus 2 and then
chain that off which is the 2x cleaning
this up 1 over X the 2's cancel so I'm
left with 1 minus x over x squared plus
2 if you want to get a common
denominator put that together that's
possibility but I'm just going to leave
it like that but to me that makes a lot
more sense than writing one over this
which means take the reciprocal and then
take the derivative of this thing which
would be a quotient rule I think this
would be a lot easier so it's nice that
you know your rules of logarithms so
here I'm going to rewrite this Ln of
sine of X and right now for our purposes
we're just going to ignore the absolute
value when we take the derivative this
so if i take F prime this is going to be
1 over the sine of x times derivative
sine of X is the cosine of X minus 1
over the sine of X plus 1 and this is
going to be times the cosine of X as
well we get a common denominator and
simplify so I'm going to multiply both
these let me write so I put a common
denominator in there I got to distribute
this I get cosine sine of X plus cosine
and this is negative sine of X cosine of
X so those will cancel out so in the
numerator I'll be left with cosine of X
in the denominator I'll be left with
sine of X sine of X plus 1 okay
so that is f prime of X how about this
one well I see two functions so I'm
going to have to do the product rule so
f prime of x is equal to your first
times the derivative second plus the
second ln x times 2x so i'm going to do
the second times 2x here not too much
simplifying but a little bit x + 2 x ln
x that's our derivative ok so hopefully
you're getting used to some of these
rules and for some of them it's made a
lot easier if you can split them up so
if I have the log of some big stuff then
what you want to do is use some of your
logarithmic rules and then just do a
piece by piece that will save you a lot
