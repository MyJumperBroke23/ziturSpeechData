ZAB51-0001|Hi this is section 5.1, natural logarithmic differentiation|Hi this is section 5.1, natural logarithmic differentiation 
ZAB51-0002|And before we start we're going to do a little warm-up, review logs a little bit and then we'll get into the differentiation|And before we start we're going to do a little warm-up, review logs a little bit and then we'll get into the differentiation
ZAB51-0003|all right so why don't you go ahead, um, we need some exponents for these first parts so why don't you pause this and go ahead and find those exponents|all right so why don't you go ahead, um, we need some exponents for these first parts so why don't you pause this and go ahead and find those exponents 
ZAB51-0004|So you can check your answers here three to the fourth is Eight, two to the fifth is thirty two, ten to the negative Third so we're moving these decimal places we have a negative exponent|So you can check your answers here three to the fourth is Eight, two to the fifth is thirty two, ten to the negative Third so we're moving these decimal places we have a negative exponent  
ZAB51-0005|and then eight to the one-third what does that mean well that means the cube root of eight is two|and then eight to the one-third what does that mean well that means the cube root of eight is two 
ZAB51-0006|correct, and then this one we're moving to the denominator so we need to use the negative. Three to the negative third is one over twenty seven|correct, and then this one we're moving to the denominator so we need to use the negative. Three to the negative third is one over twenty seven 
ZAB51-0007|go ahead on your calculator and find some of these values I can do this one and this one for you but find the other ones approximate values on your calculator|go ahead on your calculator and find some of these values I can do this one and this one for you but find the other ones approximate values on your calculator 
ZAB51-0008|so what are these all have in common well they all are dealing with exponents and logarithms|so what are these all have in common well they all are dealing with exponents and logarithms 
ZAB51-0009|so if I look at this, this is just a logarithm we can write this and logarithmic form|so if I look at this, this is just a logarithm we can write this and logarithmic form 
ZAB51-0010|sorry about that. We can write this one in logarithmic form, we do log|sorry about that. We can write this one in logarithmic form, we do log 
ZAB51-0011|and then the base the base here for the exponential is three so the base for the logarithmic is three| 
ZAB51-0012|logarithm and so the logarithm is an exponent, so this is going to be equal to my exponent which is four|logarithm and so the logarithm is an exponent, so this is going to be equal to my exponent which is four 
ZAB51-0013|and so we say the log of eighty one base three is equal to four. Now we can write all of these in|and so we say the log of eighty one base three is equal to four. Now we can write all of these in 
ZAB51-0014|Log form that's base two of thirty two is equal to five. remember logs are exponents|Log form that's base two of thirty two is equal to five. remember logs are exponents 
ZAB51-0015|and this one log this is common logarithm so its base ten and so this is equal to negative three and it's of point zero zero one|and this one log this is common logarithm so its base ten and so this is equal to negative three and it's of point zero zero one 
ZAB51-0016|and then this one|and then this one 
ZAB51-0017|okay I think you get the drift here so base eight log of two base 8 is equal to one third.|okay I think you get the drift here so base eight log of two base 8 is equal to one third. 
ZAB51-0018|now with these, the natural logarithm has a base E.|now with these, the natural logarithm has a base E. 
ZAB51-0019|and so this means e to what power gives me one? well it's got to be 0. e to what power gives me point six nine three|and so this means e to what power gives me one? well it's got to be zero. e to what power gives me point six nine three 
ZAB51-0020|remember e is approximately two point seven one eight|remember e is approximately two point seven one eight 
ZAB51-0021|that's the value of e it's naturally occurrence we call it natural base and then also these are the natural logarithms.|that's the value of e it's naturally occurrence we call it natural base and then also these are the natural logarithms.
ZAB51-0022|okay once you investigate this a little bit, we'll do it together I guess on on our calculator, we want to find the integral from one to X of one over T|okay once you investigate this a little bit, we'll do it together I guess on on our calculator, we want to find the integral from one to X of one over T
ZAB51-0023|now if we do this, I can take this one and plug it in for X. The integral from one to one is simply going to be zero|now if we do this, I can take this one and plug it in for X. The integral from one to one is simply going to be zero
